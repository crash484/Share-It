### Application Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**
   - User provides credentials
   - Password is hashed using bcrypt
   - Unique encryption key is generated
   - User data stored in MongoDB

2. **File Upload**
   - User selects file
   - File is read into memory
   - File is encrypted using user's encryption key
   - Encrypted file is saved to disk
   - File metadata stored in user's document

3. **File Sharing**
   - User selects a file to share
   - System generates unique hash using bcrypt
   - Share link created with hash
   - Link stored in public_links collection

4. **File Download**

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher - LTS recommended)
- MongoDB (v4.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Share-It
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start MongoDB**
   ```bash
   # Make sure MongoDB is running on localhost:27017
   mongod
   ```

4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   ```
   Open browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses the following configuration (can be set in a `.env` file):

- **Port**: 3000 (default)
- **MongoDB URL**: `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`
- **Database Name**: `file_transfer`
- **Session Secret**: `secret key` (**MUST be changed in production** - use a strong random string)

### File Storage
- Uploaded files are stored in: `public/uploads/{user-email}/`
- Files are encrypted before storage
- Original filenames are preserved in metadata

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Register an Account**
   - Navigate to `/Register`
   - Provide name, email, and password
   - System generates unique encryption key

2. **Login**
   - Navigate to `/Login`
   - Enter credentials
   - Access file management features

3. **Upload Files**
   - Go to "My Uploads" page
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Select file from your device
   - Confirm upload
   - File is automatically encrypted and stored

4. **Share Files**
   - View file details
   - Click "Share via link"
   - Copy generated link
   - Share link with others

5. **Manage Shared Links**
   - Navigate to "My Shared Links"
   - View all generated links
   - Delete links when needed

## Security Features

### 1. Password Security
- **Bcrypt Hashing**: All passwords are hashed with salt rounds of 10
- **No Plain Text Storage**: Passwords never stored in plain text

### 2. File Encryption
```javascript
// Encryption Process
1. Generate random encryption key (6-12 alphanumeric characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
2. Read file data into buffer
3. Apply XOR operation with key
4. Save encrypted data to disk

// Decryption Process
1. Read encrypted file
2. Apply XOR operation with same key
3. Return original file data
```

### 3. User-Specific Keys
- Each user receives a unique encryption key during registration
- Keys are 6-12 characters long
- Keys contain alphanumeric characters
- Encryption key stored in user document

### 4. Session Management
- Express sessions with secure configuration
- Sessions cleared on logout
- User authentication required for protected routes

### 5. Access Control
- File access restricted to owner
- Public links enable controlled sharing
- Link deletion removes public access

```

## How It Works

### 1. User Registration Flow
```
User submits form
      ↓
Validate email uniqueness
      ↓
Generate encryption key (6-12 chars)
      ↓
Hash password with bcrypt
      ↓
Store user in MongoDB
      ↓
User can login
```

### 2. File Upload Flow
```
User selects file
      ↓
File uploaded to server (temporary)
      ↓
Read file into buffer
      ↓
Encrypt with user's encryption key (XOR)
      ↓
Save encrypted file to public/uploads/{email}/
      ↓
Store metadata in user.uploaded array
      ↓
Delete temporary file
      ↓
Update user document in MongoDB
```

### 3. Link Sharing Flow
```
User clicks "Share via link"
      ↓
Generate hash from filename (bcrypt)
      ↓
Extract 10 characters from hash
      ↓
Create link: /SharedViaLink/{hash}
      ↓
Store in public_links collection
      ↓
Return link to user
```

### 4. File Download Flow
```
User requests file download
      ↓
Check if file accessed via link OR by owner
      ↓
Locate file in filesystem
      ↓
Read encrypted file data
      ↓
Decrypt using user's encryption key (XOR)
      ↓
Send decrypted data to browser
      ↓
Browser downloads file
```

### 5. Encryption/Decryption Process

**Encryption:**
```javascript
for each byte in file:
    encrypted_byte = original_byte XOR key_byte
    (key cycles if shorter than file)
```

**Decryption:**
```javascript
for each byte in encrypted_file:
    original_byte = encrypted_byte XOR key_byte
    (same XOR operation reverses encryption)
```

### Database Schema

#### Users Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String (hashed),
  encryptionKey: String,
  isVerified: Boolean,
  verification_token: Number,
  reset_token: String,
  uploaded: [
    {
      _id: ObjectId,
      name: String,
      type: String,
      size: Number,
      filePath: String,
      createdAt: Number
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Public Links Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  hash: String,
  file: {
    _id: ObjectId,
    name: String,
    type: String,
    size: Number,
    filePath: String
  },
  uploadedBy: {
    _id: ObjectId,
    name: String,
    email: String
  },
  createdAt: Number
}
```

## Key Functions

### Encryption Key Generation
```javascript
generateEncryptionKey()
- Generates random 6-12 character key
- Uses alphanumeric characters
- Called during user registration
```

### File Encryption/Decryption
```javascript
encryptFile(fileData, key)
- XOR operation on each byte
- Uses user's encryption key
- Returns encrypted buffer

decryptFile(encryptedData, key)
- Same XOR operation
- Reverses encryption
- Returns original file data
```

### Recursive File Operations
```javascript
recursiveGetFile(files, _id)
- Searches through nested file structure
- Supports folder hierarchy
- Returns specific file by ID

removeFileReturnUpdated(arr, _id)
- Removes file from nested structure
- Deletes physical file
- Returns updated array
```

## Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
npm start
# Uses nodemon for auto-reload
```

### Testing the Application

1. **Register a new user**
2. **Login with credentials**
3. **Upload a test file**
4. **Generate a share link**
5. **Test download functionality**
6. **Open link in incognito/private window**
7. **Verify file is accessible**

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
✅ File encryption at rest
✅ Session-based authentication
✅ User-specific encryption keys

### Production Recommendations
🔴 **CRITICAL**: Change session secret to strong random value (minimum 32 characters)
⚠️ Use environment variables for configuration
⚠️ Implement HTTPS/TLS
⚠️ Add rate limiting for API endpoints
⚠️ Consider stronger encryption (AES instead of XOR)
⚠️ Add file type validation
⚠️ Implement file size limits
⚠️ Add CSRF protection
⚠️ Implement user email verification
⚠️ Add password reset functionality
⚠️ Use Node.js LTS versions (v16+)
⚠️ Keep MongoDB updated (v4.0+)
